I made the design minimalist combined with more Intricate animations to develop my Framer Motion skills, specifically with variants and spring animation. My ReactJs skills also increased, delving into props and components from which I'm eager to learn more about it."

This project was a thrilling challenge for me where I have to use my logical thinking and game designing skills to bring these game concepts to life. I made difficulty curves and the visuals for each game and I utilized AI to create some of the algorithms I put in. I also learned about local storage to store variables for highscore tracking."
